** Good rules should adhere to the following guidelines **:
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Contain real examples from actual codebase, not imaginary ones
  - Cross-reference related rules
  - Be concise
  - Self-maintain rules in the up-to-date state
  - include both negative and positive example
